2025</span></h1><p class="c16"><span class="c21 c11">1. Executive Summary:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">This report examines the detention and arrest practices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2025, with a particular focus on allegations of aggressive tactics and the reported abductions of students involved in pro-Palestine protests. The analysis of news articles, reports from human rights organizations, official statements, and legal documents published in 2025 reveals a complex landscape of immigration enforcement under the new administration. Key findings include a reported increase in ICE arrests during the early months of 2025 compared to the previous fiscal year </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">, alongside the resumption and expansion of family detention </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. Notably, several incidents of alleged abductions of students participating in pro-Palestine protests on university campuses have been reported, raising significant concerns about the targeting of political expression </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. Policy changes, such as the rescission of protected areas policies, have broadened the scope of potential enforcement actions </span><span class="c0">33</span><span class="c10">. These developments have prompted legal challenges and drawn strong criticism from human rights organizations regarding potential violations of constitutional and human rights </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c21 c11">2. Introduction:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is primarily responsible for enforcing immigration laws within the interior of the United States, focusing on the identification, apprehension, detention, and removal of individuals unlawfully present in the country </span><span class="c0">75</span><span class="c10">. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), also part of DHS, is tasked with securing the nation&#39;s borders, which includes preventing illegal immigration and apprehending individuals attempting to enter the country unlawfully between ports of entry </span><span class="c0">76</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">The year 2025 witnessed significant shifts in immigration policy and enforcement practices following the change in presidential administration. Executive orders issued in January 2025 signaled a move towards more stringent border security measures and increased interior enforcement </span><span class="c0">40</span><span class="c10 c11">. These policy changes set the stage for a potentially more aggressive approach to immigration enforcement by both ICE and CBP. This report specifically examines the reported detention and arrest practices of these agencies in 2025, paying close attention to allegations of aggressive tactics. A key area of focus is the reported abductions of students involved in protests, as these incidents raise serious questions about the intersection of immigration enforcement, civil liberties, and freedom of expression. By analyzing available information from news media, human rights organizations, official statements from ICE and CBP, and legal documents published in 2025, this report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these practices and identify any emerging trends or human rights concerns.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c21 c11">3. Overview of Reported Detention Practices in 2025:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c24 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">3.1. ICE Detention Practices:</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_2-1 start"><li class="c24 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">The detention practices of ICE in 2025 have been shaped by a significant legal development, the settlement agreement in </span><span class="c22">Gonzalez v. ICE</span><span class="c10">, which came into effect in March 2025 </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. Historically, ICE has frequently utilized &quot;detainers,&quot; which are requests to local law enforcement agencies to hold individuals for an additional 48 hours after their release from local custody so that ICE can take them into immigration detention </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. Prior to the settlement, there was no requirement for neutral oversight to establish probable cause for these detainer arrests </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. The </span><span class="c22">Gonzalez v. ICE</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;settlement introduces changes to this practice, particularly concerning detainers issued by the Pacific Enforcement Response Center (PERC), which operates after business hours and covers 42 states </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. Unless an individual has a prior deportation order or is already in removal proceedings, PERC is now restricted from issuing detainers without undergoing a neutral review process </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. Instead of detainers, PERC is primarily permitted to issue a modified form called a &quot;Request for Notification of Release,&quot; which explicitly states that local agencies do not have the authority to continue holding an individual for ICE purposes beyond their scheduled release </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. This means that during the 12 hours per day when ICE relies on PERC, jails in the majority of U.S. states will only receive requests to notify ICE of a person&#39;s pending release and will be informed that they cannot hold individuals for ICE beyond their release date </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. A concern remains, however, that ICE might attempt to circumvent these restrictions by transferring PERC&#39;s investigation and detainer responsibilities to other ICE offices without implementing a neutral review process </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. The </span><span class="c22">Gonzalez v. ICE</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;settlement marks a significant step towards addressing constitutional concerns related to ICE detainers by mandating a neutral review process for most detainer issuances in a large portion of the United States </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10 c11">. However, the actual impact will depend on ICE&#39;s adherence to the terms and whether effective mechanisms are in place to prevent circumvention.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">In March 2025, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) released a statement noting the resumption of family detention by the Trump administration, with families being detained in facilities in Karnes County and Dilley, Texas </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. This practice, where families with children are held together in detention pending their court proceedings, has drawn criticism from various health and human rights organizations </span><span class="c0">4</span><span class="c10">. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) joined other leading health care organizations in calling for an end to family detention, emphasizing that no amount of time in detention is safe for children and that it poses a threat to their health, potentially causing psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks </span><span class="c0">4</span><span class="c10">. Studies of detained immigrants have shown that children and parents may suffer negative physical and emotional symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder </span><span class="c0">4</span><span class="c10">. Parents in detention centers have reported regressive behavioral changes in their children, such as decreased eating, sleep disturbances, clinginess, withdrawal, self-injurious behavior, and aggression </span><span class="c0">4</span><span class="c10">. Furthermore, there have been reports of the Trump administration considering the use of military bases, including Fort Bliss in Texas, to hold detained non-citizens </span><span class="c0">48</span><span class="c10">. This plan has raised concerns about the legal authority for such detentions, the minimum standards that would be required for detention conditions, and the provision of access to legal counsel </span><span class="c0">48</span><span class="c10 c11">. The renewed emphasis on family detention in 2025 represents a concerning shift in immigration enforcement practices, potentially jeopardizing the well-being of children and families seeking refuge in the United States.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Data from various sources indicates a significant increase in ICE detention in early 2025. According to the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (NNIRR), as of March 9, 2025, ICE was detaining 46,269 people, the highest number since October 2019 </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. This figure, while below the pre-pandemic levels of the first Trump administration, shows a marked increase from the 39,703 individuals detained on January 22, 2025 </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. Notably, almost half of those in ICE detention, 23,081 individuals, had no criminal record as of March 9, 2025 </span><span class="c0">45</span><span class="c10">. A report by TRAC (Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse) indicates that ICE detention grew by 4,500 people (12%) in the first month under the new administration, from January 25 to February 23, 2025 </span><span class="c0">85</span><span class="c10">. Congress has provided funding for ICE to detain a daily average of 41,500 noncitizens in FY2024, with projections of increasing detention capacity requiring further funding </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. There have also been concerns raised regarding the transparency of ICE detention numbers at facilities located at Guantanamo Bay, with reported average daily populations seeming to contradict press reports of larger numbers of individuals being detained there </span><span class="c0">45</span><span class="c10 c11">. The trend of increasing detention, particularly of individuals with no criminal record, raises questions about the necessity and appropriateness of such measures.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">ICE also utilizes Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs to monitor individuals outside of traditional detention facilities. In FY2024, Congress provided approximately $470 million in funding for these programs, with 194,427 people enrolled in FY2023 </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. As of March 7, 2025, ICE&#39;s ATD programs were monitoring 183,784 families and single individuals </span><span class="c0">45</span><span class="c10">. Despite the existence and funding of these alternatives, the significant increase in detention numbers suggests that ICE is prioritizing detention over these less restrictive and potentially more humane options </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">3.2. CBP Detention Practices:</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_3-1 start"><li class="c17 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP reported a significant decrease in encounters with individuals at the U.S.-Mexico border in early 2025. In February 2025, U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) nationwide apprehensions averaged approximately 330 per day, the lowest nationwide average in CBP history </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. Southwest border apprehensions plunged to less than 300 per day in February, with USBP apprehending 8,347 individuals crossing between ports of entry, a 71% decrease from January 2025 and a 94% decrease from February 2024 </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. CBP&#39;s Office of Field Operations (OFO) also encountered 3,362 inadmissible individuals at ports of entry along the southwest border in February 2025, representing a 90% decrease from January 2025 and a 93% decrease from February 2024 </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. This dramatic reduction in border encounters suggests a significant impact of the new administration&#39;s policies aimed at halting illegal immigration </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Despite the decrease in overall border encounters, CBP has been involved in the resumption of family detention alongside ICE. The Trump administration plans to reopen a facility in Dilley, Texas, to hold families, which would add space for up to 2,400 people </span><span class="c0">5</span><span class="c10">. The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley has been repurposed to detain migrant families facing deportation </span><span class="c0">5</span><span class="c10">. This move has been met with alarm by immigrant rights advocates </span><span class="c0">5</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP launched the CBP Home mobile application in 2025, allowing individuals unlawfully present in the U.S. or those with revoked parole to voluntarily notify the government of their intent to depart </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. This app is intended to comply with Executive Order 14159, &quot;Protecting the American People Against Invasion,&quot; by providing an orderly process for communicating departure plans </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. The administration has conveyed a clear message that voluntary departure now offers a chance to return and live the American dream, while those who do not leave voluntarily will be found, deported, and permanently barred from reentry </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li></ul><p class="c23"><span class="c21 c11">4. Analysis of Reported Arrest Practices in 2025:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li class="c24 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">4.1. ICE Arrest Practices:</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_5-1 start"><li class="c24 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced in March 2025 that ICE had made 32,809 enforcement arrests in the first 50 days of the Trump administration </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">. This figure reportedly exceeded the 33,242 at-large arrests made by ICE&#39;s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in the entire fiscal year 2024 </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">. Of those arrested in the first 50 days, nearly half (14,111) were convicted criminals, and about a third (9,980) had pending criminal charges </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">. ICE also reported arresting 1,155 criminal gang members and 39 known or suspected terrorists during this period </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">. However, an analysis by TRAC of ICE data through February 8, 2025, indicated that the average daily number of ICE arrests (724) during the first eight days of February was actually 4.7 percent lower than the average daily number of 759 arrests during all of FY 2024 under the Biden administration </span><span class="c0">89</span><span class="c10 c11">. This suggests a discrepancy between the administration&#39;s initial claims of a surge in arrests and more detailed statistical analysis over a slightly later period.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">ICE conducted various enforcement operations in 2025. In March, ICE agents raided an industrial paint business in El Cajon, California, suspected of knowingly hiring workers without legal status, arresting fewer than 20 people </span><span class="c0">91</span><span class="c10">. While a federal warrant was obtained for the search, workers reported that dozens of ICE and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents handcuffed more than 50 employees and detained them to verify their immigration status </span><span class="c0">91</span><span class="c10">. ICE also conducted a week-long multi-agency operation in the Rio Grande Valley in March, resulting in the arrest of 72 illegal aliens, including 61 criminal aliens and two documented gang members </span><span class="c0">92</span><span class="c10">. These operations often involve collaboration with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners </span><span class="c0">92</span><span class="c10">. In Mississippi, a joint operation between the Rankin County Sheriff&#39;s Department and CBP in March led to the arrest of 25 undocumented immigrants traveling through the state along the Interstate 20 corridor </span><span class="c0">95</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">The arrest practices of ICE in 2025 have faced allegations of being unlawful and conducted without proper warrants. The ACLU of Illinois and the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) announced a federal court action in March on behalf of 22 people, including a U.S. citizen, who were allegedly subjected to unlawful arrests and detention by ICE in the early weeks of the new administration </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. The lawsuit alleges that these arrests violated the Fourth Amendment and a 2022 federal court settlement that restricted ICE from making warrantless arrests </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner (D-VA) also wrote to DHS and ICE leadership regarding the alarming immigration arrest of a U.S. citizen and Virginia resident in March, who was stopped and interrogated despite providing identification </span><span class="c0">96</span><span class="c10">. The ACLU lawsuit highlighted instances of &quot;collateral arrests,&quot; where ICE officers detained individuals who were present during targeted operations but were not the primary targets themselves </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10 c11">. These allegations raise significant concerns about potential violations of constitutional rights during ICE arrest practices in 2025.</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_4-0"><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">4.2. CBP Arrest Practices:</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_6-1 start"><li class="c24 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP officers have been active in arresting individuals attempting to smuggle undocumented immigrants into the United States. In March 2025, CBP officers at the Cannon Corners border crossing in Champlain, N.Y., arrested a Canadian citizen attempting to conceal an undocumented individual in the spare tire area of a vehicle </span><span class="c0">97</span><span class="c10">. This incident highlights the ongoing efforts by CBP to combat human smuggling at the border </span><span class="c0">97</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP&#39;s arrest practices in 2025 have also been challenged with allegations of racial profiling and unlawful conduct during interior enforcement operations. In February 2025, the United Farm Workers (UFW) and five Kern County residents filed a lawsuit against DHS, CBP, and U.S. Border Patrol in response to &quot;Operation Return to Sender,&quot; a weeklong operation in January that targeted predominantly Latino areas of Kern County, California </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. The lawsuit alleges that Border Patrol agents indiscriminately stopped and arrested people of color who appeared to be farmworkers or day laborers, regardless of their actual immigration status or individual circumstances, suggesting racial profiling </span><span class="c0">44</span><span class="c10">. It further claims that individuals were coerced into signing forms for &quot;voluntary departure&quot; without being allowed to read them or understand their rights, and that agents retaliated against those who tried to exercise their rights or presented lawful immigration status by arresting them anyway </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. The lawsuit argues that these practices violated the plaintiffs&#39; Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights </span><span class="c0">44</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP also reported arrests of individuals with criminal records. In March 2025, Border Patrol agents from the Miami Sector arrested seven illegal aliens in the Florida Keys, all of whom had extensive criminal records, including convictions for elder abuse, methamphetamine trafficking, oxycodone trafficking, and driving under the influence causing serious injury </span><span class="c0">94</span><span class="c10">. In a separate incident in March, Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents arrested three individuals near Carrizo Springs, Texas, one of whom had been previously deported in 2013 and faced charges for reentry after deportation </span><span class="c0">100</span><span class="c10 c11">. These arrests indicate CBP&#39;s continued focus on apprehending and processing individuals with criminal histories and prior immigration violations.</span></li></ul><p class="c23"><span class="c21 c11">5. In-Depth Examination of Alleged Abductions of Students at Protests:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_7-0 start"><li class="c24 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">5.1. Case Study: Rumeysa Ozturk (Tufts University):</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_8-1 start"><li class="c24 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University with a valid F-1 student visa, was arrested on the evening of March 25, 2025, while on her way to meet friends for an iftar dinner during Ramadan </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. The arrest was carried out by six plainclothes individuals, some of whom were masked and traveling in unmarked vehicles, near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. Surveillance video of the incident shows the agents approaching Ozturk, handcuffing her, and taking her away in an SUV, an event described by a witness as resembling a kidnapping </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. Tufts University later stated that Ozturk&#39;s visa had been terminated </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. Her arrest came shortly after she was doxxed by a Zionist vigilante group, Canary Mission, apparently due to an op-ed she co-authored in the student newspaper criticizing Tufts&#39; response to pro-Palestine protests and urging the university to divest from Israel </span><span class="c0">11</span><span class="c10">. The Department of Homeland Security claimed, without providing evidence, that Ozturk was arrested because she &quot;engaged in activities in support of Hamas&quot; </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10">. Despite a federal judge issuing an order that Ozturk should not be moved outside of Massachusetts without 48 hours&#39; notice, she was transferred to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. Lawmakers, including Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Elizabeth Warren, and Edward Markey, strongly condemned her arrest, calling it a &quot;disturbing arrest and detention&quot; and demanding an explanation from the administration, her release, and the restoration of her visa </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_7-0"><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">5.2.

The University of Alabama confirmed his detention by federal immigration authorities </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10">. The Department of Homeland Security stated that his arrest was made in accordance with the State Department&#39;s revocation of his student visa due to &quot;significant national security risk concerns,&quot; although specific details were not provided </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10">. Doroudi was initially held at Pickens County Jail, and while jail records did not list any charges against him, there were reports that ICE detainees at this facility are typically transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10">. According to a message shared among Iranian students at the university, Doroudi entered the U.S. in January 2023 on an F-1 student visa that was reportedly revoked six months later </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10">. The National Iranian American Council suggested that Doroudi&#39;s arrest was a retaliation against his speech and activism against war </span><span class="c0">12</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li></ul><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_7-0"><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21 c11">5.3.

Khalil was involved in pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024 and was described as a leader in the university&#39;s pro-Palestine movement </span><span class="c0">18</span><span class="c10">.

Official Statements and Policy Changes by ICE and CBP in 2025:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_c-0 start"><li class="c24 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made several public statements in early 2025 emphasizing a stricter approach to immigration enforcement. She announced a significant increase in ICE arrests in the first 50 days of the administration and reiterated the commitment to deporting known terrorists, cartel members, and gang members </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">. Secretary Noem also stressed the administration&#39;s intention to enforce all immigration laws and end &quot;catch-and-release&quot; policies, ensuring that individuals apprehended for immigration violations are detained until their removal </span><span class="c0">79</span><span class="c10">. She announced the termination of the CBP One app, which had been used to schedule appointments for asylum seekers at the border </span><span class="c0">105</span><span class="c10">. Her statements consistently conveyed a message of prioritizing border security and national safety through robust enforcement measures </span><span class="c0">104</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">ICE press releases in 2025 primarily focused on enforcement actions targeting individuals with criminal histories and those subject to removal orders. Examples include the removal of a man wanted in El Salvador for murder </span><span class="c0">93</span><span class="c10">, the arrest of an illegal Mexican national involved in a vehicular homicide </span><span class="c0">93</span><span class="c10">, and multi-agency operations resulting in the arrests of dozens of &quot;criminal aliens&quot; </span><span class="c0">92</span><span class="c10">. These releases often highlight the collaboration between ICE and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies </span><span class="c0">92</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">CBP news releases in early 2025 emphasized the significant decrease in border encounters and apprehensions following the implementation of new executive orders </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. CBP also reported arrests related to drug and human smuggling </span><span class="c0">107</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and announced the launch of the CBP Home app to facilitate voluntary departures </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. Acting CBP Commissioner Pete Flores stated that the agency was aggressively implementing the President&#39;s Executive Orders to secure the borders, resulting in historic lows in border apprehensions </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Significant policy changes occurred in 2025 regarding immigration enforcement at sensitive locations. On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy that had generally prevented ICE and CBP agents from making arrests at schools, places of worship, and hospitals without prior authorization from agency headquarters </span><span class="c0">33</span><span class="c10">. This rescission gave ICE agents broader authority to take enforcement actions in these previously protected areas </span><span class="c0">33</span><span class="c10">. ICE issued interim guidance on January 21, 2025, regarding enforcement actions in or near courthouses, generally advising officers to avoid such actions in non-public areas like family court </span><span class="c0">34</span><span class="c10">. By March 2025, ICE was under a court order related to enforcement actions in or near places of worship from a specified list of locations </span><span class="c0">34</span><span class="c10">. For university campuses, the rescission meant they no longer had special protection from immigration enforcement </span><span class="c0">35</span><span class="c10">. Institutions were advised to establish protocols for responding to ICE presence on campus, including verifying credentials and warrants before granting access to non-public areas </span><span class="c0">35</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c21 c11">7. Perspectives from Human Rights Organizations and Advocacy Groups:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">Human rights organizations and advocacy groups have voiced significant concerns regarding the reported detention and arrest practices of ICE and CBP in 2025. The resumption of family detention has been widely criticized for its detrimental impact on the well-being of children, with groups like AILA, AAP, and Amnesty International highlighting the potential for trauma and long-term harm </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. Allegations of unlawful and warrantless arrests by ICE and CBP have prompted legal challenges and strong condemnations from organizations such as the ACLU and NIJC, who argue that these practices violate constitutional rights </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. The targeting of students involved in pro-Palestine protests has been particularly alarming, with concerns raised that immigration enforcement is being used to suppress free speech and political dissent on university campuses </span><span class="c0">10</span><span class="c10">. The increase in ICE detention numbers, coupled with the fact that nearly half of detainees have no criminal record, has led to questions about the necessity and justification for such widespread detention </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10">. The ACLU has also expressed concerns about the potential expansion of immigration detention nationwide </span><span class="c0">54</span><span class="c10">. Human rights groups fear that the increased enforcement and the rescission of protected areas policies will have a chilling effect on immigrant communities, making individuals afraid to access essential services like healthcare and education </span><span class="c0">33</span><span class="c10 c11">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c21 c11">8. Legal Challenges and Lawsuits Related to 2025 Practices:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">Several legal challenges have been filed in 2025 concerning the detention and arrest practices of ICE and CBP. The </span><span class="c22">Gonzalez v. ICE</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;settlement, effective March 2025, aims to reform ICE detainer practices by requiring neutral review in many cases </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. The ACLU of Illinois and NIJC filed a lawsuit in March challenging alleged unlawful warrantless arrests by ICE in the Midwest, seeking the release of detained individuals and accountability for the agency&#39;s actions </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. The United Farm Workers (UFW) and Bakersfield residents sued DHS, CBP, and Border Patrol in February over &quot;Operation Return to Sender,&quot; alleging racial profiling and unlawful arrests in Kern County, California </span><span class="c0">42</span><span class="c10">. Habeas corpus petitions were filed on behalf of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil and Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri, challenging their detention by ICE as violations of their constitutional rights, particularly the First Amendment </span><span class="c0">17</span><span class="c10">. A lawsuit was also reportedly filed on behalf of Columbia University student Yunseo Chung, who was targeted for her involvement in pro-Palestine protests </span><span class="c0">17</span><span class="c10 c11">. These legal actions highlight the significant concerns surrounding the legality and constitutionality of the immigration enforcement practices in 2025.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c21 c11">9. Comparative Analysis and Trends:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">Comparing ICE arrest and removal numbers in early 2025 with data from FY 2024 reveals some discrepancies. While Secretary Noem announced a substantial increase in arrests in the first 50 days of the new administration </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c10">, TRAC&#39;s analysis of February data indicated a slight decrease in the daily average of arrests compared to FY 2024 under the previous administration </span><span class="c0">89</span><span class="c10">. ICE detention numbers showed a clear upward trend in early 2025, increasing from the end of the Biden administration </span><span class="c0">81</span><span class="c10">. In contrast, CBP reported a dramatic decrease in border apprehensions in January and February 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 </span><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c10">. Notably, the practice of family detention, which had been reduced under the Biden administration, was resumed and planned for expansion in 2025 </span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c10 c11">. These trends suggest a shift in enforcement focus, with decreased border encounters but potentially intensified interior enforcement in certain areas, including a concerning emphasis on detention and the targeting of activists.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c21 c11">10. Conclusion and Recommendations:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10 c11">The analysis of reported detention and arrest practices by ICE and CBP in 2025 reveals a number of concerning trends. The alleged abductions of students involved in pro-Palestine protests raise serious questions about the potential use of immigration enforcement to suppress political expression, impacting fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and academic freedom. The resumption and planned expansion of family detention, despite the known harms to children, indicate a move towards more punitive measures. Allegations of unlawful arrests, warrantless stops, and racial profiling continue to plague both agencies, as evidenced by the numerous legal challenges filed. While CBP reported a significant decrease in border encounters, ICE&#39;s interior enforcement appears to be intensifying in key areas, particularly concerning detention.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c10 c11">To address these issues, the following recommendations are made:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_d-0 start"><li class="c24 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">Reinstate and strengthen policies that protect sensitive locations, including schools, universities, hospitals, and places of worship, from immigration enforcement actions to ensure these remain safe and accessible to all members of the community.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">Implement more robust oversight and accountability mechanisms for ICE and CBP arrest and detention practices, including the establishment of independent bodies to investigate allegations of abuse and misconduct.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">Guarantee due process and access to legal representation for all individuals facing immigration detention or removal proceedings, recognizing the complexity of immigration law and the vulnerability of those in custody.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">End the practice of family detention immediately and invest in community-based alternatives to detention that have proven to be more humane and cost-effective while ensuring compliance with immigration proceedings.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">Uphold and protect the First Amendment rights of students and activists, ensuring that immigration enforcement powers are not misused to target individuals based on their political views or activism.</span></li><li class="c4 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c11">Promote greater transparency in ICE and CBP operations by requiring the regular release of comprehensive data on arrests, detentions, enforcement actions, and internal investigations, allowing for public scrutiny and informed policy debate.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c10 c11">Legal reforms are also necessary to strengthen protections against unlawful immigration enforcement practices. This includes clarifying and reinforcing the rights of non-citizens against arbitrary stops, searches, and arrests, as well as ensuring robust judicial review of immigration enforcement actions that may violate constitutional rights. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term impacts of these evolving enforcement practices on immigrant communities and the broader society.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c21
