                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Core Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>NRx is an anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian, and pro-hierarchy political and philosophical movement. It advocates for the acceleration of capitalism and technological systems to collapse liberal democracy, and ultimately replace it with a new, elite-led order. The Dark Enlightenment criticizes Enlightenment values (reason, progress, equality) and suggests that society is inherently hierarchical, not egalitarian.</p>
