                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-4">Neo-Reactionary (NRx) & The Dark Enlightenment</h2>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Core Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>NRx is an anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian, pro-hierarchical political and philosophical movement.  It views liberal democracy as a failing system destined for collapse.  NRx advocates accelerating this collapse through capitalism and technology, aiming for a replacement by a new order led by a technocratic elite.  The Dark Enlightenment, a related but broader concept, fundamentally critiques the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, progress, and equality, arguing for inherent human inequality and the inevitability of hierarchical social structures.</p>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Key Concepts</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Anti-Democracy:</strong> Democracy is seen as inherently unstable and susceptible to manipulation, leading to societal decline.  NRx posits that inherent human inequality makes egalitarian systems inherently flawed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technological Acceleration:</strong>  Accelerating technological and capitalist forces is seen as a *means* to an end – the destabilization and eventual collapse of the current socio-political order.  This isn't an end in itself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neo-Cameralism (Yarvin):</strong>  A specific proposal for replacing democracy with a system where sovereign states are run like corporations, with shareholders (the elite) holding absolute power.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Cathedral:</strong>  A term coined by Moldbug to describe the interconnected network of institutions (academia, media, government) that maintain and propagate the dominant liberal ideology.  NRx seeks to dismantle or bypass this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exit vs. Voice (Hirschman):</strong> NRx often emphasizes "exit" (secession, creating alternative communities) rather than "voice" (political activism within the existing system).</li>
                         <li><strong>Patchwork (Moldbug):</strong> A vision of a future political landscape composed of numerous, independent, sovereign "patches" or city-states, each with its own form of governance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                 <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Main Goals (Implicit & Explicit)</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                        <li>Dismantle or circumvent the perceived dominance of progressive/liberal ideology and institutions.</li>
                        <li>Establish a post-democratic order, often envisioned as a form of technocratic or neo-monarchical rule.</li>
                        <li>Promote a return to traditional, hierarchical social structures (though interpretations of "traditional" vary).</li>
                         <li>Foster intellectual and social spaces outside of the mainstream ("The Cathedral").</li>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-4">Key Thinkers & Figures</h2>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Nick Land</h3>
                    <p>Widely considered the foundational figure of NRx.  His early work blended accelerationism, cybernetics, and continental philosophy. Later work focuses more explicitly on anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian themes. Key works include *The Dark Enlightenment* (essay) and *Fanged Noumena* (collected writings).  He emphasizes the destabilizing and transformative power of unchecked capitalism and technology.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Mencius Moldbug (Curtis Yarvin)</h3>
                    <p>Popularized the term "Dark Enlightenment."  Known for his blog "Unqualified Reservations." Proposes "neocameralism" – a system of governance where sovereign states are run like joint-stock companies, with shareholders having absolute authority.  Heavily critiques democracy and the "Cathedral."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Michael Anissimov</h3>
                    <p>An early proponent of NRx ideas and a frequent contributor to Moldbug's blog.  He focused on the potential of technology and transhumanism to create a new, hierarchical social order, often advocating for a form of aristocratic rule by a technologically advanced elite.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Peter Thiel</h3>
                    <p>A prominent venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal.  While not explicitly identifying as NRx, Thiel's views on the incompatibility of freedom and democracy, his support for seasteading (creating independent communities at sea), and his general skepticism towards democratic institutions resonate strongly with NRx themes. He has funded various projects aligned with these ideas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</h3>
                    <p>An anarcho-capitalist philosopher and economist. His book *Democracy: The God That Failed* is highly influential within NRx circles. Hoppe argues for a society based on private property and voluntary association, but he also emphasizes the importance of hierarchy and traditional social order, rejecting egalitarianism.</p>

                         <li><strong>Nick Bostrom:</strong> Though not NRx, his work on existential risk and superintelligence is relevant to NRx discussions on technology and the future.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alexander Dugin:</strong> A Russian political philosopher.  His "Fourth Political Theory" shares some anti-liberal and traditionalist themes with NRx, though there are also significant differences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vince Garton:</strong> Blogger and writer associated with the early development of online NRx communities.</li>
