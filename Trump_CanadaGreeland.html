<center><a href="https://malcolmnance.substack.com/p/urgent-warning-trump-is-planning?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=2fxdua&triedRedirect=true">-Original Article-</a></center>
    <p class="author">By Malcolm Nance</p>
    <p class="date">March 8, 2025</p>
    
    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The article assesses that the Trump administration intends to invade and annex Canada and Greenland. The author claims this conclusion is based on rhetoric from Trump and his cabinet, as well as reported phone conversations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The timeline suggested is 6-18 months of political destabilization followed by military action.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Key Evidence Cited</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Trump reportedly referring to Justin Trudeau as "Governor of the 51st State"</li>
        <li>Trump's statement about "annexing Canada economically"</li>
        <li>A Truth Social post claiming Canada "ceases to exist as a viable country" without US subsidies</li>
        <li>Implementation of 25% tariffs against Canada</li>
        <li>Reported phone call between Trump and Trudeau that "devolved into obscenities"</li>
        <li>Cabinet members adopting the "51st state" terminology</li>
        <li>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's statements about Canada's economy being "entirely based on America"</li>
        <li>Similar rhetoric about Greenland, questioning Denmark's claim to the territory</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Alleged Three-Phase Plan</h2>
    <div class="phase">
        <h3>Phase 1: Political Destabilization of Greenland</h3>
        <p>Creating a false narrative that Greenlanders want to join the US, supported by social media campaigns. The goal is to gain access to Greenland's mineral deposits while creating a pretext to position military assets for a surprise invasion of Canada.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="phase">
        <h3>Phase 2: Economic Destabilization of Canada</h3>
        <p>Funding fringe political groups like "Wexit" that support western Canadian provinces joining the US. Creating confusion through social media campaigns and false polls to suggest Canadian support for joining the US.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="phase">
        <h3>Phase 3: Military Invasion</h3>
        <p>Invading Greenland and then Canada, possibly under the guise of "training exercises" similar to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Alleged Motivations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to natural resources, particularly rare earth minerals</li>
        <li>Territorial expansion</li>
        <li>Implementation of "Neo-Reactionary" ideology allegedly supported by Elon Musk</li>
        <li>Elimination of regulations on resource exploitation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="consequences">
        <h2>Predicted Consequences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Constitutional crisis in the United States</li>
            <li>The US becoming a "pariah nation" globally</li>
            <li>NATO invoking Article 5, putting the US at war with 31 other NATO countries</li>
            <li>US military personnel refusing orders (estimated at 60%)</li>
            <li>Canadian armed resistance and insurgency</li>
            <li>Potential for a "Second American Civil War" as border states refuse federal orders</li>
            <li>Clashes between National Guard units and pro-Trump forces</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
