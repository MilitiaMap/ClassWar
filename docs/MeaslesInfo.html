            <!-- Q1: Booster Needed? -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. I was vaccinated against measles as a child. Do I need a booster?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> Probably not. The main exception in the U.S. involves individuals vaccinated between <strong>1963 and 1968</strong>. During this period, some may have received an older, less effective "killed" measles vaccine instead of the current live attenuated vaccine. It's best to <strong>ask your doctor</strong> to review your specific situation and records.

            <!-- Q2: Get Another MMR Anyway? -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. Should I just get another MMR vaccine anyway to be safe?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> The best approach is to <strong>talk to your doctor</strong>. They may recommend a blood test to check your immunity levels (called "titers"). It's important to remember that the MMR vaccine is a <strong>live, attenuated vaccine</strong>. Therefore, it should generally <strong>not</strong> be given to people who are significantly immunosuppressed, pregnant, or have had severe allergic reactions to previous doses or vaccine components. Your doctor can advise based on your health status.

            <!-- Q3: Immunity After Having Measles? -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. If I had measles a long, long time ago, am I still immune?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> Yes, generally. Natural infection with measles typically provides <strong>lifelong immunity</strong> for the vast majority of people. While rare exceptions might exist, immunity is usually robust. If you have concerns, you can <strong>talk to your doctor</strong> about having your immunity levels (titers) checked.

            <!-- Q4: Measles Transmission -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. How is measles transmitted?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> Measles is <strong>extremely contagious</strong> and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is one of the most infectious airborne pathogens known. The virus can remain infectious in the air for <strong>up to 2 hours</strong> after an infected person leaves an area. If one person has measles, about <strong>9 out of 10</strong> susceptible (unvaccinated or non-immune) people close to them will also become infected.

            <!-- Q5: Post-Exposure Options -->
             <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. What can I do if I think I’ve been exposed to measles?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> There are options for post-exposure prophylaxis if action is taken quickly. Contact your healthcare provider immediately.
                    <ul>
                        <li class="ml-4 list-disc">You may be able to receive the <strong>MMR vaccine within 72 hours (3 days)</strong> of exposure to help prevent illness or make it milder.</li>
                        <li class="ml-4 list-disc">Alternatively, <strong>immunoglobulin (IG)</strong> can be given within <strong>6 days</strong> of exposure to provide immediate, temporary protection, especially for those who cannot receive the live vaccine (like infants, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals).</li>
                    </ul>
                     Note: You generally cannot receive both MMR and IG for post-exposure prophylaxis. Your doctor will determine the best course of action.

            <!-- Q6: Symptom Onset -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. When do symptoms of measles appear after exposure?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> Symptoms typically start <strong>10 to 14 days</strong> after exposure to the virus. Initial symptoms often resemble the flu or a cold, including a runny nose, cough, red watery eyes (conjunctivitis), and fever. A characteristic rash appears a few days later, usually starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. The rash appears as red spots on lighter skin, but can look darker brown, purple, or even whitish on darker skin tones.

            <!-- Q7: Vaccinating Kids -->
            <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. Should I get my kids vaccinated with the MMR vaccine?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A. Yes, absolutely</strong>, unless there is a specific medical reason (contraindication) why they shouldn't receive it, which your doctor will identify. There is significant misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine. If you have concerns, please <strong>discuss them with your trusted healthcare provider</strong> and rely on their expert medical advice.

             <!-- Q8: HHS Response (Author's View) -->
             <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. If measles is so serious, why isn’t HHS speaking out about the outbreak in TX?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A.</strong> (Author's perspective) Unfortunately, the current head of HHS, Mr. Kennedy, has spent the last two decades spreading misinformation about the MMR vaccine specifically. It takes a person of character to admit they were wrong, so.

             <!-- Q9: Measles Parties -->
             <div class="p-4 rounded-md ">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Q. My child has measles and the guy next door wants to send his kids over to get them infected, too (a "measles party"). Should I allow this?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>A. Absolutely not.</strong> Intentionally exposing children to measles is dangerous and irresponsible. Measles can lead to severe complications, even in healthy children. In the U.S., about 1 in 4 unvaccinated people who get measles require hospitalization. Potential complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling, which can cause permanent brain damage), blindness, and even death. Participating in such an activity could potentially expose you to legal liability if the neighbor's children suffer serious complications. Vaccination is the safe and recommended way to protect children.
