      <p>
        The global landscape of millionaires is diverse and multifaceted. While approximately 56 million individuals worldwide have a net worth of over $1 million, the vast majority fall within the entry-level bracket. However, the upper tiers—though much smaller in number—command significant influence and possess highly diversified asset portfolios. The trends in regional growth and industry-specific wealth accumulation continue to shape the future of global wealth distribution.
