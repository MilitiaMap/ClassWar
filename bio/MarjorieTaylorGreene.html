                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Marjorie Taylor was born in Milledgeville and grew up in Georgia. After graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in Business Administration, she and her then-husband, Perry Greene, took over her father's commercial construction and renovation company, Taylor Commercial, Inc. She reportedly served as the company's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for several years.
                    </p>
                     <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                       Alongside the construction business, Greene was also involved in the fitness industry, co-owning and operating a CrossFit affiliate gym (CrossFit Passion) in Alpharetta, Georgia. She largely remained a private citizen focused on business and family until her relatively recent entry into politics.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 section-heading">Entry into Politics & Congressional Career</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                       Greene emerged as a political figure in 2019-2020, initially planning a run for Georgia's 6th district before switching to the more conservative 14th district after the incumbent Republican announced his retirement. Running on a platform strongly aligned with Donald Trump's "America First" agenda, fiscal conservatism, gun rights, and socially conservative values, she quickly gained traction in the heavily Republican district.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Even before winning the election, Greene attracted national attention and controversy for her past embrace of conspiracy theories and inflammatory online rhetoric. Despite this, she won the Republican primary runoff and the general election in November 2020, taking office in January 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Her first month in Congress was tumultuous. Due to mounting pressure over her past social media activity (including apparent endorsements of violence against Democrats) and promotion of conspiracy theories, the House of Representatives took the rare step of voting (largely along party lines) to remove her from her assigned committee posts (Budget Committee; Education and Labor Committee) in February 2021.
                    </p>
                     <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Despite being stripped of committee assignments for nearly two years, Greene remained a high-profile and vocal member of Congress, known for her staunch support of Donald Trump, confrontational style towards opponents (including some Republicans), and focus on culture war issues. After Republicans won control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections (in which Greene was easily re-elected), she was assigned to the influential Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the Committee on Homeland Security in January 2023. She has continued to be a prominent, albeit polarizing, voice within the GOP conference.

                    <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-sm">
                       Marjorie Taylor Greene has been one of the most controversial figures in contemporary American politics, attracting significant scrutiny for her rhetoric, past associations, policy stances, and conduct both before and during her time in Congress.

                            <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                Greene gained notoriety for promoting numerous baseless and often harmful conspiracy theories via social media videos and posts prior to her election. This included expressing support for QAnon (a sprawling far-right conspiracy movement; she later distanced herself, claiming she was "allowed to believe things that weren't true"), suggesting school shootings like Parkland and Sandy Hook were staged "false flag" events, promoting 9/11 conspiracy theories, and spreading anti-Muslim and antisemitic tropes (such as suggesting California wildfires were started by a space laser controlled by a Jewish banking family, for which she faced widespread condemnation). She has also been a prominent purveyor of COVID-19 misinformation regarding vaccines and masks, leading to temporary suspensions from social media platforms.

                            <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                Investigations into Greene's past social media activity revealed she had "liked" posts calling for violence against prominent Democratic figures, including calls for the execution of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has engaged in public confrontations with colleagues (like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and activists (like Parkland survivor David Hogg, whom she harassed on video). Her rhetoric frequently employs inflammatory language, including comparing COVID-19 mask mandates to the Holocaust (for which she later apologized), making transphobic remarks, and using charged language against political opponents, contributing to a polarized political climate.

                            <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                The culmination of her past controversial statements and social media activity led the House of Representatives, then under Democratic control, to vote 230-199 (with 11 Republicans joining Democrats) in February 2021 to remove her from her committee assignments. This unprecedented action against a first-term member highlighted the severity with which her conduct was viewed by many colleagues.

                             <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                Like many members of Congress, Greene's stock trading activities have faced scrutiny from ethics watchdogs. Reports have noted trades in companies related to sectors relevant to potential legislation or committee oversight (e.g., investments in defense contractors, energy companies, and pharmaceutical firms during relevant policy debates). While trades reported may adhere to the disclosure requirements of the STOCK Act, the timing and nature of some transactions have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, fueling broader debates about whether lawmakers should be permitted to trade individual stocks. No formal charges of illegal insider trading have been brought.

                             <p class="text-red-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                Greene's confrontational style has extended to fellow Republicans. She has engaged in public spats with colleagues and leadership. Notably, in July 2023, she was reportedly voted out of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus following internal disputes, including a public confrontation with fellow Rep. Lauren Boebert. This underscored her sometimes fractious relationship even within the right wing of the GOP.
